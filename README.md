# Assignment

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to have the candidate work with the same tools that are used in every-day Chama web development, so we can learn how one would perform while solving common development tasks that we have.

### Description
For this assignment you are supposed to build a good ol' to-do app and the ability to add, complete and edit a TODO is mandatory but with some features (described below) to spicy things up!

### Stack
In Chama, our frontend stack consists of React + Redux :heart:, therefor it's required that the same stack is used in this assigment. Complementary libraries are free to use (e.g. lodash).

### Firebase
Chama relies on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to give our dealers a real-time experience. Because of this, we require that some features of Firebase are used in this assignment. There is a free-plan (default) that supports the requirements of this assignment (Hosting, Auth and real-time Database) and you should be able to start creating a project with you own Google account. Eezy peezy.

### Features
* Sign-in/sign-out functionality using Firease Auth;
* Use Firebase real-time database to keep all the TODOs;
* Manage database state using Redux;
* Assign priority to a TODO and order them by highest to lowest priority;
* Set a due time. Add real-time visual and auditive hints to the TODO item that indicate that the due time is near and has passed;
* Host working app in a Firebase Hosting environment.

# Hints
* You don't need to spend time creating a dev/build environment, using [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (and other alike tools) is totally ok!
* Never done anything with Firebase? You can follow [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and it should give you a nice starting point.
* If you wish to spend less time writing boilerplate code, go to http://todomvc.com/, in this website, you will find many sample implementations of the same TODO application, every time using a different framework. You can choose the [React](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) implementation as a starting point. It's OK to use the same styling as the original application.
* Don't re-invent the wheel! Custom styling and set of components (like datepickers, buttons, input fields, etc.) is a plus but definitely not needed, you should spend more time on the application itself, so using UI libraries is ok! You can try [Material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) or [Elemental UI](https://github.com/elementalui/elemental) which have great integration with React environments.

# Delivery
You can create a repository in GitHub to host the assigment. We need both Firebase hosting and Github repo URLs.

And that's it. Happy coding! :metal:
