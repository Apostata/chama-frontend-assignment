# Assignment

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to see how the candidate performs using the same tools that are used in every-day chama web development so we can judge how one would perform solving common development tasks that we have.

### Stack
In Chama, our frontend stack consists in React + Redux, so it is needed that the same stack is used in this assigment. Complementary libraries are free to use (e.g. lodash).

### First steps
Go to http://todomvc.com/. On this website, you will find many sample implementations of the same TODO application, every time using a different framework. You can choose [React](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) implementation to have a place to start at. It's ok to use the same styling as the original application.

### Firebase
Chama relies on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to give our dealers a real-time experience, so for this assignment some features will be required to be implemented using it. There is a free-plan that supports the requirements of this assignment (Hosting, Auth and real-time Database).

### Added Features
* Sign-in/sign-out functionality using Firease Auth;
* Use Firebase real-time database to keep all the todos;
* Manage database state using Redux;
* Assign priority to a TODO and order them by highest to lowest priority;
* Set a due time. Add real-time visual / auditive hints to the TODO item that indicate that the due time is near / has passed;
* Host working app in a Firebase Hosting environment.

### Delivery
You can create a repository in GitHub to host the assigment. We need both Firebase hosting and Github repo URLs.
