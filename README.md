# Assignment

Go to http://todomvc.com/. On this website, you will find many sample implementations of the same TODO application, every time using a different MV* framework. 

Choose one of the sample applications, and add the following features. We use React, but you are free to choose whichever framework you like.

- Assign priority to a TODO by dragging it up or down
- Set a due time. Add real-time visual / auditive hints to the TODO item that indicate that the due time is near / has passed. 

You can upload your solution to GitHub and send me the URL.
