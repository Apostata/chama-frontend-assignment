# Assignment

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to have the candidate work with the same tools that are used in every-day Chama web development, so we can learn how one would perform while solving common development tasks that we have.

### Stack
In Chama, our frontend stack consists of React + Redux :heart:, therefor it's required that the same stack is used in this assigment. Complementary libraries are free to use (e.g. lodash).

### First steps
Go to http://todomvc.com/. On this website, you will find many sample implementations of the same TODO application, every time using a different framework. You can choose the [React](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) implementation as a starting point. It's OK to use the same styling as the original application.

### Firebase
Chama relies on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to give our dealers a real-time experience. Because of this, we require that some features of Firebase are used in this assignment. There is a free-plan that supports the requirements of this assignment (Hosting, Auth and real-time Database).

### Added Features
* Sign-in/sign-out functionality using Firease Auth;
* Use Firebase real-time database to keep all the TODOs;
* Manage database state using Redux;
* Assign priority to a TODO and order them by highest to lowest priority;
* Set a due time. Add real-time visual and auditive hints to the TODO item that indicate that the due time is near and has passed;
* Host working app in a Firebase Hosting environment.

# Delivery
You can create a repository in GitHub to host the assigment. We need both Firebase hosting and Github repo URLs.

And that's it. Happy coding! :metal:
